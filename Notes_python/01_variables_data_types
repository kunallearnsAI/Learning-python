                                                                       ...Variable and data types...
 
What is variable?
-----------------
>A variable is like a container that holds the data.
>When you Create a variable you're creating a space in memory and assigning it to some value.
Example:
a = 2
# 'a' here is variable that is used to refer the value and '2' is the value store in variable and datatype of '2' is integer type. 
b = True
# 'b' here is variable that is used to refer the value and 'True' is the value store in variable and datatype of 'True' is boolean type. 
c = "Kunal"
# 'c' here is variable that is used to refer the value and 'Kunal' is the value store in variable and datatype of 'Kunal' is string type. 
d = none
# 'd' here is variable that is used to refer the value and 'none' is the value store in variable and datatype of 'none' is none type. 

What is a datatype?
-------------------
In python,datatypes are the type of data a variable stores.

# There are 14 built in data types,grouped into 8 main catagories.
1. Numeric Type:
   # Integer:
   Ex- 3,-8,0
   # Float: real numbers including decimal part
   EX- 7,-3,0.5,-6.2
   # Complex: contain real and imaginary part.
   EX- 3+4i
   >now 'i' is iota(imaginary part) its value in mathematics is -1 and 3 is the real number.
2. Boolean Type:
   >They contain only two value 'True' or 'False'
   EX:
   is_sunny = True
   passed_exam = False
3. Text Type:
   # String:
   >It represent text in " " or ' '.
   EX:
   name = "Kunal" or 'Kunal'  [both " and ' are correct]
4. None Type:
   It represent absence of a value or null.
   EX:
   X = none
5. Sequence Type:
   # List:
     >A list is an ordered collection of data with elements seprated by comma and enclose with square brackets.
     >Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created.
     EX:
     list1 = [8 , 2.3 , [-4,5] , ["apple" , "orange"]]
     print(list1)
   # Tuple:
     >The tuples are the ordered collection of the data with elements seprated by commas(,) and enclose in Parentheses.
     >They are imutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed after tuple is created.
     EX:
     Tuple1 = (("Parrot" , "Sparrow") , ("Data" , "science"))
     print(Tuple1)
   # Range():
     >In python range() is built in function use to genrate sequence of numbers.
     >It is commanly used in loops when you have to repeate something certain number of times.
     EX:
     for i in range(5):
     print(i)
        Tne output will be 0,1,2,3,4
6. Set types:
     # Set:
       >A set is built in data type in python used to store unodered collection of unique elements.
       >The sets are mutable and represented in curly bracket{}
       EX:
       Set = {1 , 2 , 3 }
     # Frozenset:
       They are same as set datatype but thay are imutable.
7. Mapping Types:
     # Dictionry:
       >They are the data types which store the collection of data in key-value pairs.
       EX:
       dict1 = {"name": "sakshi" , "age": 20 , "can drive": "yes"}
       print(dict1)
8. Binary types:
     # Bytes:
      > The bytes is a data type used to represent a group of byte number.
      >Bytes i just like an array which can hold multiple value.It can store number between 0 to 255(included).
      > They cannot hold negative numbers.
      >They are immutable.
       EX:
         a = [10 , 20 , 30 , 40] #list
         b = bytes(a)   # list to bytes
         print(b[0],b[1])


         for i in b:
             print(i)
     # Bytearray:
       >They are same as bytes but they are Mutable.
