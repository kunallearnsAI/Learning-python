#  Basic Calculator in Python

This is a beginner-level calculator project created during my Python learning journey.

##  What It Does
- Takes two numbers and an operator from the user
- Performs +, -, *, /
- Uses `float()` to support decimal numbers

##  Example
```
Enter the operator (+,-,*,/): +
Enter the first number: 2.5
Enter the second number: 3.5
6.0
```
